      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Happy Dog Mobile app empowers dog owners to explore and discover healthy natural nutrition for their beloved pets. Healthy diets lead to healthier happier dogs, owners benefit from less expensive food costs and their dogs experience fewer ailments.</p>
            <br> <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>As a team, we performed user research and competitive analysis, and created user flow, wireframes and prototype in a 3-week sprint. I worked on this as part of my George Washington University UX/UI Design Certificate. </p>

    <br><br><h2>User Research</h2>
    <br><h3>Research Strategy</h3>
    <p>The first thing we focused on was our research strategy. In order to identify the flaws in the current UX and UI, we conducted a usability test by interviewing people that fit our user archetype. These were users over the age of 50 who had lost a loved one within the past 5-10 years. Before we began our interviews we first needed to do two things.
      First we conduct a competitor analysis. Aside from using and understanding Memento, this also gave us an insight in the market space and provided additional context for the problem we are working on. Secondly we create an interview guide in preparation for Usability Testing. This enabled us to conduct our interviews in a consistent and controlled manner.</p>
      <br><h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
      <p>As part of our Competitor Analysis, we conducted an analysis on three apps with similar product offerings to Memento. These were: Thread.Care, Saga and A Lasting Tale.
        We focused our research on User Interface elements and User Experience Flows â€“ including the Sign Up process, Recording stage, User Ratings and the Features.</p>
